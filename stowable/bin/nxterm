#!/usr/bin/env sh

# This script is simply an alias for alacritty.
# Its purpose is to fix GNOME apps such as file-roller,
# which is unable to open files in an archive because
# GNOME has an explicit list of terminals it checks.
#
# nxterm is used here because it's the first supported
# terminal in that code block which uses `-e` not `-x`.
